# PS1

The first problem set is a group assignment and has two parts: 
  1. Part 1 is an exercise in using the actions of GitHub, specifically pushing and pulling a repository after making edits. This needs to be completed one at a time.
  2. Part 2 involves coding fundamentals of python. This can be completed by working together in your group.

To get started, clone the repository and open the PS1.py file. The comments in this file provide step-by-step instructions!
